# Find out what day of the year it is (eg. 42 / 366)
# Create variables for each season - these variables should store a range of days of the year (similar to above) that covers when that season occurs.
# Check if the current day of the year falls within a certain range of days to find out what the current season is.
# Similarly, use ranges on the current hour of the day to identify if itâ€™s morning, noon, afternoon, evening, nighttime, midnight
# Tell the user what stage of the day & what season of the year it is.
# Use hashes to store the ranges for the seasons and stages of the day.
