## Q1:
<!-- Research the development of the internet from 1980 to today. You must describe at least FIVE key events in the development of the internet. You can refer to events, people of significance, or technologies and how they have changed over time. 300 - 500 -->

#### 1. 1989/1990/1991: Proposal and Creation of the World Wide Web (www) & HTML  
Before the web, "*there was different there was different information on different computers, but you had to log on to different computers to get at it. Also, sometimes you had to learn a different program on each computer. Often it was just easier to go and ask people when they were having coffee…*”, Sir Tim Berners-Lee.  
Often confused with the internet itself, the web is actually just the most common means of accessing data online in the form of websites and hyperlinks. [History](https://www.history.com/news/who-invented-the-internet). Marking an important part of the internet's history by allowing the world to easily view it.


#### 2. 1994: Yahoo! is created
Yahoo! began as a student hobby and evolved from there, Jerry Yang and David Filo were looking for a single place to find useful web sites and for a way to keep track of their personal interests on the Internet. [History-Computer](https://history-computer.com/Internet/Conquering/Yahoo.html). In one year, Yahoo! grew to 10,000 website links and over 1 million views per day. [Medium](https://medium.com/greatepicurean/the-history-of-yahoo-edf6ebfc725). Yahoo! proved, before Google, the need to have a place to access all the sites on the web.


#### 3. 1995: JavaScript is created
In 1995, a Netscape programmer named Brandan Eich developed a new scripting language in just 10 days. [Springboard](https://www.springboard.com/blog/history-of-javascript/). The reason I  included JavaScript is due its importance as a web technology, which can be determined from the fact that it is currently used by 94.5% of all websites. [Medium](https://medium.com/@mindfiresolutions.usa/how-important-is-javascript-for-modern-web-developers-2854309b9f52). 

#### 4. 1998: Napster went live (and Google)
Napster was specifically designed for sharing digital music files (in MP3 format) across a web-connected network. The service was extremely popular, approximately 80 million at its height. [Lifewire](https://www.lifewire.com/history-of-napster-2438592). This software application launched the world of P2P file-sharing, causing record-labels and movie studios a world of grief. But it shows how quickly ideas take place on the internet, quicker than they can become regulated. 

#### 5. 2007: iPhone and Mobile Web 
A history of the internet can't be complete without the historic event of 
then-CEO, Steve Jobs, presenting what we now know as a smartphone.
How could such a device change the the internet?! In 2009, mobile web made up 0.7% of total web traffic. [Oberlo](https://au.oberlo.com/statistics/mobile-internet-traffic). At 2020, it now sits at 62%. [Quoracreative](https://quoracreative.com/article/mobile-marketing-statistics).

#### 6. 2016: Google Assistant
Once the realm of pure science fiction, voice-based artificial intelligence is now a reality.  
One of the oldest parts of Google Assistant is Google Voice Search, making its debut on Android smartphones in 2011, and while its functionality was basic by today’s standards, being able to give your phone voice commands marked a serious change in the way we were starting to interact with technology.
[Yahoo! Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/everything-know-google-assistant-203743219.html)

### Extra points of Notice - Pre 1980
#### 1900s: Tesla toyed with ideas of "world wireless system"
How cool is Nikola Tesla?! He proposed ideas to use Earth and its atmosphere as electrical conductors. He claimed this system would allow for point-to-point wireless telecommunications and broadcasting on a global scale.
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wireless_System). That cool.

#### 1958: Creation of the Modem
Short for (MOdulator—DEModulator) heralded a new age of communications and played a major role in the explosion of the internet. These nifty little devices turn a digital signal into an electrical signal and back again. No point having all these fancy websites if there is nothing to send that data out.

## Q2:
<!-- Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:
Explain how each technology has contributed to the development of the internet. 50 - 100 words per dot point -->
For the purpose of the next few questions we will use a parcel delivery service example across these topics to best describe their purposes.

  - packets
  
A packet is the unit of data that is routed between an origin and a destination on the Internet which are passed over TCP/IP networks. Their goal is to send information reliably so data does not have to be sent as a large file.

E.g. These (network) packets we will refer to as the parcel.


  - IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)

Computers use a unique identifier to send data to another computer. Most networks today use the TCP/IP protocol as the standard for communicating. In the TCP/IP protocol, the unique identifier for a computer is called its IP address.

There are two standards for IP addresses: (IPv4) and (IPv6). All computers have an IPv4 address, and many are starting to use the new IPv6.

**IPv4** uses 32 binary bits to create a single unique address on the network. 
**216.27.61.137**   
**IPv6** uses 128 binary bits to create a single unique address on the network. **2001:cdba:0000:0000:0000:0000:3257:9652**  
[HowStuffWorks](https://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet/basics/what-is-an-ip-address.htm)

E.g. When we want to send a parcel to another person, we need to write the address we want the parcel to go to. We may also write our own address on the parcel so that it can be returned to us if need. Our addresses are equivalent to the IP addresses.

  - routers and routing

<!-- THIS STILL NEEDS TO BE REWRITTEN A BIT MORE, STILL TOO CLOSE TO SOURCE -->
A router connects devices within a network by forwarding data packets between them. This data is sent between devices, or from devices to the internet. The router does this by assigning a local IP address to each of the devices on the network. This ensures that the data packets end up in the right place, rather than getting lost within the network.
[MakeUseOf](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/technology-explained-how-does-a-router-work/)

E.g. Let's say we we were sending this parcel to someone who works in a big office and that office has a mailman. We know the street address of the building, and we know the name of the person, but we don't know the route from the curb of the building to the person. The router is like the mailman of the office, helping our parcel get to the right person.


  - domains and DNS

A domain is a user friendly alias of an IP address. Rather than having to remember a long, random string of numbers, letters and characters to visit a website, you can simply find the website you're looking for by searching (most of the time), the company name you are looking for.
However, the web browsers only recognize IP address, so the Domain Name System (DNS) translates the domain names back to an IP address so the browser can load the Internet resources.
[Cloudfare](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/what-is-dns/)

E.g. When we send the parcel, it's easier for us to remember a street address than it is GPS coordinates. The street address is the domain and the IP address is the GPS coordinate.

## Q3:
<!-- Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:


Explain how each technology has contributed to the development of client and server communication over the internet 50 - 150 words for each technology -->

  - TCP

When any file (such as an email, HTML file, GIF or URL request) is sent from one place to another on the Internet, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) layer divides the packet into "chunks" for routing. When they have all arrived, they are reassembled into the original file by the TCP layer at the receiving end.
[SearchNetworking](https://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/packet)

The TCP/IP protocol was a major milestone for Internet, as it more or less gave the Internet its name due to the nature of its job. Before TCP/IP there was the Network Control Protocol (NCP) which allowed hosts of a single network to communicate. TCP/IP replaced NCP as it was designed to interconnect multiple networks to form a type of 'internet'.

  - HTTP and HTTPS

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol was developed by Sir Tim Berners-Lee back in 1990's. HTTP, “a stateless system”, allowed web browsers and servers to communicate through the exchange of data, and only enables connection on demand.

HTTPS protocol is an extension of HTTP. That “S” in the abbreviation comes from the word Secure and it is powered by Transport Layer Security (TLS). Without that "S", any data you enter into the site is sent as plaintext and therefore susceptible to interception or eavesdropping.
[GlobalSign](https://www.globalsign.com/en/blog/the-difference-between-http-and-https). 
HTTP, associated with the creation of the World Wide Web, and HTTPS is the natural progression of that Protocol allowing the data to be encrypted and therefore secure. And the next progression is HTTP/2

  - web browsers (requests, rendering and developer tools)

1. DNS Lookup
   1. translate domain to IP address
2. Browser sends an HTTP request
   1. sends a request for the HTML to the IP address (server) obtained from above
3. Server responds 
   1. sends back the requested HTML file, or an error, or a redirect (this sends a new GET request for the HTML)
4. Browser begins to render HTML
   1. Process HTML markup and build the DOM tree.
   2. Process CSS markup and build the CSSOM tree.
   3. Combine the DOM and CSSOM into a render tree.
   4. Run the layout on the render tree to compute the geometry of each node.
   5. Paint the individual nodes to the screen.
5. Browser sends additional requests for objects embedded in the HTML file (CSS files, images, javascript, etc.)

You can monitor all of this analyze HTTP Requests and Responses with DevTools to see how a/your website loads. You may find ways to reduce load times or find an error that causes your site to load slowly.

When the web browser fetches data from an internet connected server and it then uses a piece of software called a rendering engine to translate that data into text and images. This data is written in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and web browsers read this code to create what we see, hear and experience on the internet.

## Q4:
<!-- Identify THREE data structures used in the Ruby programming language and explain the reasons for using each. 50 - 100 words on each data structure -->
There were many interesting articles on Data Structures for Ruby. What I took away from those articles was the relationship between each structure and Big O notation. With Arrays/Lists and Hashes being some of the most common data structures, I had to pick them due to the fundamental difference between them. (i.e. their scalability. read: what data set you have). The descriptions below are just a basic explanation to the pro's and cons of each structure. 

- Arrays/Lists

  - When dealing with a small data set, something like a shopping list, or a to-do list, these are great examples of when an Array would be appropriate. The data we are dealing with is small, and if we wanted to find something in this list, running a loop over this list is of negligible time to find something. However, imagine if we have a grocery list of 10 000 people. That's one very, very long list. Finding Bob's groceries in that list, we have to walk through each person's list before we find his. This is the shortcoming of an array. This can be explained as O(N). That is, the amount of time/work it takes to find what we want, grows linearly with the length of the list. If only there was a way to store Bob's list so that we can just type in his name and have his list be returned. Did you just hear that?....Hash is jumping up and down at the back screaming that they know the solution to our problem.

- Hashes

  - It's Hash's time to shine. The beauty of the Hash is the solution to a lot of large data set problems. We need to be able to just type in our man Bob and get his list, and we don't want to look at everyone's list to do it. A Hash will do just that. Our big O notation is now O(1). Which means, no matter how big our list gets, it will take the same amount of time to find Bob's list, as it will Shirley's list. Hash's work by a key, value pair. You type in a key, and you get the value. This is because the way a Hash is created in memory. The key points to a specific part of memory and returns what's there. An Array does also work like this when we pass an index into the Array. E.g. array[2] will point to the 3rd element in that array, thi is O(1) as well. The issue with this is that we have no idea who the 3rd person is in our list of 10 000. Hash's solve this problem.


Just to summarize the differences here. An Array will only take up as much memory in the computer as it needs (the size of the list), but it will take a long time to find something. A Hash will sacrifice memory (as it stores a large group of values even though your Hash might be small, but it will find you something extremely quickly). So you need to think about the data set you have and what data structure will be most appropriate. 

- Stacks/Queues

  - I cheated and picked 2 topics for this category because they complement each other. Stacks and Queues are both part of the Array class and the best way to differentiate them, is LIFO and FIFO, respectively. A Stack represents (Last In First Out), think of a stack of plates, and Queues to be FIFO (First In First Out ). Think about any queue in the real world ever, or as my brain thought, people who camp out for iPhones. When Googling for use cases of each, I came across a simple explanation for a Stack use case. Ctrl + Z. No I am not asking you to press it, but we want to undo the last thing we did, so we need to retrieve the last process we just put on top of our list of processes we have done so far. A cool Queue example on the other hand, Google uses this in their "Zero Shutter Lag" feature for their cameras on their Pixel phone line. They do this by storing the last few (hundred or so) frames in a circular queue, and when you click the button, it selects the best frame from the most recent frames.

  ## Q5: 
  <!-- Describe the features of interpreters and compilers and how they are different. 100 - 200 words on each way code is executed. -->

  - Interpreters

    -   In a nutshell, Compilers and Interpreters do the same job, which is converting higher level programming languages to machine code. A high level language is the syntax of Ruby, JavaScript etc, us Humans use to instruct the computer what to do. However, computer processors only understand binary, 1s and 0s, which is machine code. This is where the above come in to rescue us.  
    Languages like Ruby and Python uses this program. An Interpreter translates one statement at a time and it will continue translating until the first error is met, which makes debugging a lot easier as it stops when it hits a bug. However the drawback of this is that interpreted code runs slower. But luckily for us web developers, interpreters are more efficient due to quick debugging of small changes that are made regularly. Which also makes interpreters a great tool for a learning environment as it allows students to program interactively.
[Guru99](https://www.guru99.com/difference-compiler-vs-interpreter.html)  
[Programiz](https://www.programiz.com/article/difference-compiler-interpreter)  
[Webopedia](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/7793/interpreter)

  - Compilers
  <!-- THIS IS BLATANTLY COPIED, NEED TO REWORD -->

  In short, a compiler converts a program from a human-readable format into a machine-readable format. As to how a compiler works, that is indeed complicated. There are books and university courses on the subject. I will attempt to briefly outline the main stages of the process, but this will be a very cursory overview.
  1. Lexing - break up the text of the program into "tokens". The tokens are the "words" of the programming language, such as identifiers (keywords, variable names, function names, etc.) or operators (=, *, &, etc.).
  2. Parsing - convert the sequence of tokens into a parse tree, which is a data structure representing various language constructs: type declarations, variable declarations, function definitions, loops, conditionals, expressions, etc.
  3. Optimization - evaluate constant expressions, optimize away unused variables or unreachable code, unroll loops if possible, etc.
  4. Translate the parse tree into machine instructions (or JVM byte code).

  Again, I stress that this is a very brief description. Modern compilers are very smart, and, consequently, very complicated

## Q6:
<!-- Identify TWO commonly used programming languages and explain the benefits and drawbacks of each. 200 - 400 words on each language -->
<!-- BLATANT COPY -->
### **Javascript**

### Advantages of JavaScript
**Speed** - JavaScript tends to be very fast because it is often run immediately within the client's browser. So long as it doesn't require outside resources, JavaScript isn't slowed down by calls to a backend server. Also, major browsers all support JIT (just in time) compilation for JavaScript, meaning that there's no need to compile the code before running it.  
**Simplicity** - JavaScript's syntax was inspired by Java's and is relatively easy to learn compared to other popular languages like C++.  
**Popularity** - JavaScript is everywhere on the web, and with the advent of Node.js, is increasingly used on the backend. There are countless resources to learn JavaScript. Both StackOverflow and GitHub show an increasing amount of projects that use JavaScript, and the traction it's gained in recent years is only expected to increase.  
**Interoperability** - Unlike PHP or other scripting languages, JavaScript can be inserted into any web page. JavaScript can be used in many different kinds of applications because of support in other languages like Pearl and PHP.
Server Load - JavaScript is client-side, so it reduces the demand on servers overall, and simple applications may not need a server at all.
Rich interfaces - JavaScript can be used to create features like drag and drop and components such as sliders, all of which greatly enhance the user interface and experience of a site.
Extended Functionality - Developers can extend the functionality of web pages by writing snippets of JavaScript for third party add-ons like Greasemonkey.  
**Versatility** - There are many ways to use JavaScript through Node.js servers. If you were to bootstrap Node.js with Express, use a document database like MongoDB, and use JavaScript on the frontend for clients, it is possible to develop an entire JavaScript app from front to back using only JavaScript.
Updates - Since the advent of ECMAScript 5 (the scripting specification that JavaScript relies on), ECMA International has been dedicated to updating JavaScript annually. So far, we have received browser support for ES6 in 2017 and look forward to ES7 being supported in the future.
### Disadvantages of JavaScript
**Client-Side Security** - Since JavaScript code is executed on the client-side, bugs and oversights can sometimes be exploited for malicious purposes. Because of this, some people choose to disable JavaScript entirely.  
**Browser Support** - While server-side scripts always produce the same output, different browsers sometimes interpret JavaScript code differently. These days the differences are minimal, and you shouldn't have to worry about it as long as you test your script in all major browsers.
[freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-javascript/)

### **Python**

 ### Advantages
 **Easy to Read, Learn and Write**  
 Python is a high-level programming language that has English-like syntax. This makes it easier to read and understand the code.

Python is really easy to pick up and learn, that is why a lot of people recommend Python to beginners.

You need less lines of code to perform the same task as compared to other major languages like C/C++ and Java.

**Improved Productivity**  
Python is a very productive language. Due to the simplicity of Python, developers can focus on solving the problem.

They don’t need to spend too much time in understanding the syntax or behaviour of the programming language. You write less code and get more things done.

**Interpreted Language**
Python is an interpreted language which means that Python directly executes the code line by line. In case of any error, it stops further execution and reports back the error which has occurred.

Python shows only one error even if the program has multiple errors. This makes debugging easier.

**Dynamically Typed**
Python doesn’t know the type of variable until we run the code. It automatically assigns the data type during execution. The programmer doesn’t need to worry about declaring variables and their data types.

**Free and Open-Source**
Python comes under the OSI approved open-source license. This makes it free to use and distribute. You can download the source code, modify it and even distribute your version of Python. This is useful for organizations that want to modify some specific behaviour and use their version for development.



#### Disadvantages
**Slow Speed**
1. We discussed above that Python is an interpreted language and dynamically-typed language. The line by line execution of code often leads to slow execution. The dynamic nature of Python is also responsible for the slow speed of Python because it has to do the extra work while executing code. So, Python is not used for purposes where speed is an important aspect of the project.

2. **Not Memory Efficient**
To provide simplicity to the developer, Python has to do a little tradeoff. The Python programming language uses a large amount of memory. This can be a disadvantage while building applications when we prefer memory optimization.

Any doubts in Python advantages and disadvantages till now? Mention in the comment section. We will be happy to help you!!

3. **Weak in Mobile Computing**
Python is generally used in server-side programming. We don’t get to see Python on the client-side or mobile applications because of the following reasons. Python is not memory efficient and it has slow processing power as compared to other languages.

4. **Database Access**
Programming in Python is easy and stress-free. But when we are interacting with the database, it lacks behind. The Python’s database access layer is primitive and underdeveloped in comparison to the popular technologies like JDBC and ODBC. Huge enterprises need smooth interaction of complex legacy data and Python is thus rarely used in enterprises.

5. **Runtime Errors**
As we know Python is a dynamically typed language so the data type of a variable can change anytime. A variable containing integer number may hold a string in the future, which can lead to Runtime Errors. Therefore Python programmers need to perform thorough testing of the applications.

Python is a simple, versatile and a complete programming language. It is a great choice for beginners up to professionals. Although it has some disadvantages, we can observe that the advantages exceed the disadvantages. Even Google has made Python one of its primary programming languages.
